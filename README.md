# phantombotupdater4linux
This is a script to Update your Phantombot on Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

Comments can be found in the update.sh File so you can understand what the file does.

Thanks to steinwaywhw for the Download code (https://gist.github.com/steinwaywhw/a4cd19cda655b8249d908261a62687f8)


Required Programs for this to work:

curl, cd, mv, rm, unzip, chmod, wget and cp

apt-get install curl unzip wget


Installation:

Just copy the Files over to the directory where your PhantomBot should be located. 
You might choose a different Location though but you have to configure the settings with the sample.cfg then

If you want to run more then one Bot rename the Sample.cfg and run the script by using ./update.sh yourconfig.cfg
